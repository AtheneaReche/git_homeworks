It was a very old house--it had an attic under the roof and a cellar under the
ground and an overgrown garden with huge old trees in it.

Coraline's family didn't own all of the house--it was too big for that. Instead
they owned part of it.

There were other people who lived in the old house.

Miss Spink and Miss Forcible lived in the flat below Coraline's, on the ground floor.
They were both old and round, and they lived in their flat with the number of
ageing Highland terriers who had names like Hamish and Andrew and Jock.
Once upon a time Miss Spink and Miss Forcible had been actresses, as Miss Spink
told Coraline the first time she met her.

"You see, Caroline," Miss Spink said, getting Coraline's name wrong, "both myself
and Miss Forcible were famous actresses, in our time. We trod the boards, luvvy.
Oh, don't let Hamish eat the fruitcake, or he'll be up all night with his tummy."
